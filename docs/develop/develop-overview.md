# Develop Office Add-ins

> [!TIP]
> Please review [Building Office Add-ins](../overview/office-add-ins-fundamentals.md) before reading this article.

## Common concepts

All Office Add-ins are built upon the Office Add-ins platform and share a common framework through which certain capabilities can be implemented. This means that regardless of whether you're creating an add-in for Excel, Outlook, or another Office host, you can implement features such as dialog boxes, add-in commands, task panes, and single sign on (SSO). Likewise, regardless of the type of Office Add-in you're building, you'll need to understand things like Office JavaScript API programming patterns, the Office Add-in manifest file, localization, performance, privacy, and more.

Common concepts like these are covered in this section of the documentation: **Common guidance** > **Develop**. Review information in this section of the documentation before exploring information in the host-specific section that corresponds to the type of add-in you're building (for example, [Excel add-ins](../excel/index.md)).

## Host-specific concepts

After you're familiar with the common concepts that apply to all types of add-ins, explore the host-specific documentation for the type of add-in you're building. Each of these sections contains documentation specifically tailored to building add-ins for a specific Office host.
