The Office JavaScript APIs contain objects and members for building add-ins and interacting with Office content and web services. There is a common object model that is shared by Excel, Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, OneNote and Project. There are also more extensive host-specific object models for Excel and Word. These APIs provide access to well-known objects such as paragraphs and workbooks, which makes it easier to create an add-in for a specific host.
