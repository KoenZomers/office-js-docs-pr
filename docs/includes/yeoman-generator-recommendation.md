> Although it's possible to create Office Add-ins using Visual Studio, using the Yeoman generator may provide a better developer experience in many ways. Not only does the Yeoman generator provide a wider range of options for project types, frameworks, and languages than Visual Studio does for Office Add-in projects, it's also more actively maintained. This means that as new types of Office Add-ins become available in the future, they're likely to be available in the Yeoman generator before they're available in Visual Studio. Also, as recommended programming patterns continue to evolve, code in the projects that the Yeoman generator creates will likely reflect those changes long before code in the projects that Visual Studio creates.
